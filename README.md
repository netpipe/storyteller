# storyteller
brainmap style storyteller with yes , no , maybe options as checkpoints

if you pick maybe it will take you on either or path sometimes with a more guided option to the next checkpoint. sometimes neural networks/groups of people are used to tell the story inbetween.



https://github.com/tsymalla/mindmap-editor seems like a better option to use as a base
